There are 2 programs in this repository:
1)niki.py
2)phone.py

running niki.py will give you a text file of all the contents within that directory.
running phone.py will give you phone numbers of indian style

**phone.py is actually a scrapper for the text file with a regex written to find pattern of indian phone numbers
** provide your directories accordingly in fields like walk_dir ,and proper filename to phone.py program
** imported niki.py to phone.py,if not required,you can directly call two different programs independently


#It is made into a pypi package manager link:'https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=niki&version=0.1&:action=display'
#there are scopes to this project,we can add email finders as well as name finders and many other things accordingly
